# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Classification

## The Necessity of This Study:
Diabetic retinopathy, a condition prevalent in a large number of people with prolonged diabetes, poses a significant threat. Early identification and appropriate intervention are essential to prevent vision impairment and enhance the prognosis for patients. Nevertheless, the manual analysis of retinal images for detecting diabetic retinopathy can be labor-intensive and prone to mistakes. This underscores the urgent requirement for a reliable, automated system that can help medical experts assess the severity of diabetic retinopathy efficiently.

## Problem Statement
Current techniques for identifying and evaluating Diabetic Retinopathy typically depend on subjective evaluations and significant manual effort, resulting in potential discrepancies and inefficiencies in diagnoses. Additionally, the rising number of diabetes cases, coupled with a scarcity of ophthalmologists, compounds the difficulties in conducting prompt and accurate screenings. Thus, there is a critical need to create a dependable and robust automated system that can precisely detect and grade diabetic retinopathy, facilitating early interventions and tailored treatment strategies.

## Dataset
Data Description: The dataset comprises a substantial set of high-resolution retinal images taken in diverse imaging environments. Each image has been evaluated by a medical expert who has determined the presence of Diabetic Retinopathy and provided a score based on a scale from 0 to 1. The ratings correspond to the following classifications:

Diabetic Retinopathy ---> 0
No Diabetic Retinopathy ---> 1
